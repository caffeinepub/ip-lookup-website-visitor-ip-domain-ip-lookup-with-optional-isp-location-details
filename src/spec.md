# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Fix the configured publish/deployment domain slug so deployment passes platform validation.

**Planned changes:**
- Update the app’s publish/deployment domain to the valid slug `"ip-look-up"` derived from the requested name “ip look up”.

**User-visible outcome:** The app can be published/deployed successfully without the domain validation error, with no UI text changes.
